# About This Fork

This fork of the original project was created as a part of my learning journey focused on:

- Implementing the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern
- Practicing **clean code structure** with feature-based folders
- Writing **well-structured Pull Requests** to simulate professional workflows
- Improving code **maintainability, readability, and testability**
